"""Text splitting utilities for streaming TTS.

Sentence chunking uses OmniVoice ``chunk_text_punctuation``, which avoids
splitting on ``.`` / ``,`` when they sit between digits (decimals like ``3.14159``
and grouping like ``1,50,00,000``). A period followed by a space still ends a
sentence (e.g. ``It was 3. Then …``).
